_TESS_lightcurves_raw
columns: 'JD','mag','err'
These are raw light curves as extracted from the FFI (Full-Frame Images)

_TESS_lightcurves_median_after_detrended
columns: 'JD', 'mag_clean', 'mag_after_cbv', 'err' 
These are detrended lightcurves, calculated from the raw light curves.
The column 'mag_after_cbv' is calculated from the raw light curves after a detrending step called "CBV detrending", whereas the 'mag_clean'
is an additional detrending step using a median detrending after the CBV detrending.

_TESS_lightcurves_outliercleaned
columns: 'JD','mag','err'
These are detrended light curves with a further step of outlier cleaning.
They are calculated from the _TESS_lightcurves_median_after_detrended light curves, using their 'mag_clean' column.


NaN values in raw light curves can be:
*********, ********, 9.999999, NaN

Whereas all other light curves have NaN values only as:
*********
